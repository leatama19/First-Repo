# Week-09 Task

For this task I have made a fish game in processing. You play as a fish trying to eat food and avoid trash from falling from the top of the screen.

**How to play**
- Move mouse to swim around
- Catch the yellow circles (food) to earn points
- Avoid the rubbish (grey) 
- Touching the rubbish will lead to game over
- There are three waves in total, it gets faster each time

# Requirements
