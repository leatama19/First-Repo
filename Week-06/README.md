# Week-06
**1. Sci-fi Audio Task**

The aim for my code was to create a sci-fi soundscape using three different oscillators:

- **Sine Wave (SinOsc)**
- **Triangle Wave (TriOsc)**
- **Sawtooth Wave (SawOsc)**

I have chosen different frequencies and amplitude for each oscillator to add layered texture to the sound.

I have also included a low pass filter to the saw wave, this has created a softer sound to the higher frequencies. 

I gained inspiration from listening to a range of sci-fi soundtracks, which led me to design a more subtle, still sound. It was meant to reflect the moment a character has just landed on a new planet and is silently taking in their surroundings.

**2. Sketch Audio Task**

This sketch uses a a sine wave oscillator for both sound and visuals. As you move the mouse, the sound changes and the visuals pulse smoothly to match it.

**3. Task development**
I developed my sci-fi audio task by adding interactive controls and visuals. It allows you to change the amp and the tone using the mouse and the circle shows how it responds to the sound. I have also added text at the bottom of the sketch.

## Requirements
*Written in Processing 4.3*
*Imported Processing Sound library*

## Operation
Use mouse to interact with sketch
