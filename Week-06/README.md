# Week-06
**1. Sci-fi Audio Task**

The aim for my code was to create a sci-fi soundscape using three different oscillators:

- **Sine Wave (SinOsc)**
- **Triangle Wave (TriOsc)**
- **Sawtooth Wave (SawOsc)**

I have chosen different frequencies and amplitude for each oscillator to add layered texture to the sound.

I have also included a low pass filter to the saw wave, this has created a softer sound to the higher frequencies. 

I gained inspiration from listening to a range of sci-fi soundtracks, which led me to design a more subtle, still sound. It was meant to reflect the moment a character has just landed on a new planet and is silently taking in their surroundings.

**2. Sketch Audio Task**

This sketch uses a a sine wave oscillator for both sound and visuals. As you move the mouse, the sound changes and the visuals pulse smoothly to match it.

# Requirements
*Written in Processing 4.3*
*Imported Processing Sound library*

# Operation
Use mouse to interact with sketch
