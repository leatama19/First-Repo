# Week-10 Task

This sketch is inspired by halo halo, a filipino dessert made of colourful ingredients mixed in a bowl. The particles represent the different bits inside of the halo halo.

Each particles uses three vectors:
- location
- velocity
- acceleration

When you click on the bowl a burst of colourful particles generate. Eventually it slowly fades away and disappear once they float off screen.

**Developed sketch:**
I have developed my sketch further by introducing a "pop" text effect that appears at the mouse position each time the user clicks.

*features:*
- Created a popTimer variable to control how long the text "pop" stays on screen
- Add random wind and gravity to particles
Displays "pop" text at mouse click position
Keeps particle system with loc,vel,acc

**How to interact:**
Click anywhere on the canvas 

## Requirments
*Written in processing 4.3*
*No special libraries required*

## Design notes
Initial idea:
- Bowl of halo halo at the bottom of the screen
- When use clicks, particles burst out from the bowl
- my aim for this sketch was to make it feel fun and culturally inspired
