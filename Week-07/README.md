# Week-07 Task
For this sketch I have created a drum pattern using four audio samples. I picked a few samples from the resources provided and modified the example from class to build a looping 8 beat rhythm.

**Audio samples I have used:**
- kick
- snare
- click
- clap

I have also decided to incorporate visuals inspired by the code in class. The clap plays randomly on certain beats including the background color which changes to a new random color on every beat.

**what my code does:**
- loops through an 8 beat pattern using framecount % 8
- adds a clap randomly on beat 4
- background changes to a random color every beat 
- shows the beat number on screen
