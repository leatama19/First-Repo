# Week-04 Task

This sketch generates a 2D landscape using Perlin noise. The noise value represents terrain heights which are used to blend the two colors smoothly. I have chosen to use teal/green/blue and white to create a duotone effect. 

I have attempted to animate the terrain by gradually changing the noise input over time using a time variable. This creates a dynamic effect where the landscape appears to shift smoothly.

Below I have also included a link to a recording of the sketch running.
